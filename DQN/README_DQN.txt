To test the model during training just execute all the code.
To test the model performances, upload weights and execute all the code until "Training" paragraph,
then stop it and execute the next code blocks, "create_video" implementation and the call at the function "create_video".
The function creates a video to see a simulation of the agent playing greedy with the weights loaded.
It's important to run the first code block to import from a github package to avoid downloading and unpacking all Atari Roms.
